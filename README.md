# CsgoFloatScript
A script for calculating required floats for making trade-ups with a specific output float

# Useage
1. Add the skins and their floats to input_skins.json (you can include more than 9 skins to check all permutations of your skins to have a higher chance of finding the target float)

2. Go to https://docs.csfloat.com/#introduction and follow the steps to create an API key, then set it in secrets.json

3. Set your target float (between 0.1 and 0.000000000001) then run the script
